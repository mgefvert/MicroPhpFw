# MicroPhpFw

Microscopic PHP framework based on Nifty.

The Micro PHP Framework is a completely text-based framework with templating 
capabilities, in less than 500 lines of PHP and JS code (aside from the JQuery 
and MarkDown libraries).

There is no database, no editing support, no administration, just simple text
files. Should be secure enough, incredibly lightweight, and yet easy enough
to be used with a minimum of introduction.

Since we use MarkDown for most of the pages, it should also be editable by
just about "anyone".
