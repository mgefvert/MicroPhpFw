            <h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>
            
            <p>Micro PHP Framework is a microscopic framework for building websites 
                based on a similar, much larger framework called Nifty PHP Framework.</p>
            <p>The Micro PHP Framework is a completely text-based framework with templating 
                capabilities, in less than 500 lines of PHP and JS code (aside from the JQuery 
                and Markdown libraries).</p>
            <p>There is no database, no editing support, no administration, just simple text
                files. Should be secure enough, incredibly lightweight, and yet easy enough
                to be used with a minimum of introduction.</p>
            <p>Some of the features available includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Easily handled <a href="#menus">menu system</a> suited for one or two levels of navigation
                    (but the sky's the limit).</li>
                <li>Small footprint, can deploy powerful websites in less than 1 MB.</li>
                <li>Practically all pages can be edited with a simple text editor.</li>
                <li>You can use HTML, PHP/HTML or <a href="#markdown">Markdown</a> - making it easy enough
                    for just about "anyone" to maintain sites, once it's built.</li>
                <li>Extensible <a href="#styles">template system</a> - switch site layout in seconds.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <!-- Pages -->
            <h2><a name="pages">Pages</a></h2>
            
            <p>Everything revolves around a page. A page is a document, that consists either
                of HTML, PHP code mixed in with HTML, or something called <a href="#markdown">Markdown</a> - an
                easily used formatting language.</p>
            <p>Pages reside under the path <tt>/pages</tt>. A page called <tt>/pages/info.html</tt> 
                can be reached using a url like <tt>http://your-site.com/info</tt> - nothing else is required.
                The file extension doesn't matter - as long as it's a recognized one - the system
                will still find the page and serve it up.</p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Page filename</th>
                    <th>URL that can reach it</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>/pages/index.md</td>
                    <td>http://your-site.com/<br>http://your-site.com/index<br>http://your-site.com/index.html</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>/pages/info.html</td>
                    <td>http://your-site.com/info<br>http://your-site.com/info.html</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>/pages/products/index.md</td>
                    <td>http://your-site.com/products<br>http://your-site.com/products/index<br>http://your-site.com/products/index.html</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>/pages/about/contact-us.html</td>
                    <td>http://your-site.com/about/contact-us<br>http://your-site.com/about/contact-us.html</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>/pages/x/y/z.phtml</td>
                    <td>http://your-site.com/x/y/z<br>http://your-site.com/x/y/z.html</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>There are three different extensions you can use:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>.html</b> - just plain HTML embedded in the master template and served up</li>
                <li><b>.phtml</b> - just plain HTML, but mixed in with PHP; the page is evaluated as
                    a PHP page before serving it to the user.</li>
                <li><b>.md</b> - a Markdown page, which can contain HTML as well, but mostly uses
                    the Markdown style and formatting to build a web page.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Master pages -->
            <h2><a name="master">Master Pages</a></h2>
            
            <p>Each page is fed through the "master page" in the system. The master page determines
                the layout, the HTML structure, and so on - basically, the results of a particular
                page it just inserted at the appropriate location in a new, complete page.</p>
            <p>The master page is located under <tt>/pages/_master/default.phtml</tt> - since the
                default theme is called "default". By adding a different theme, e.g. "business",
                the master template would be called <tt>/pages/_master/_business.phtml</tt>.</p>
            <p>Consider the following page:</p>
            <code>&lt;h1>Hello, world!&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>This is my first page!&lt;/p></code>
            <p>When this gets fed (as "content") into the master page looking like this:</p>
            <code>&lt;html>
    &lt;head>
        &lt;title>My website&lt;/title>
    &lt;/head>
    &lt;body>
        &lt;div id="content">
            <tt>&lt;?= $this->content ?></tt>
        &lt;/div>
        <tt>&lt;? if ($this->footer): ?></tt>
            &lt;div id="footer">
                <tt>&lt;?= $this->footer ?></tt>
            &lt;/div>
        <tt>&lt;? endif; ?></tt>
    &lt;/body>
&lt;/html></code>
            <p>The end result is going to look like this:</p>
            <code>&lt;html>
    &lt;head>
        &lt;title>My website&lt;/title>
    &lt;/head>
    &lt;body>
        &lt;div id="content">
            &lt;h1>Hello, world!&lt;/h1>
            &lt;p>This is my first page!&lt;/p>
        &lt;/div>
    &lt;/body>
&lt;/html></code>

            <!-- Sections -->
            <h2><a name="sections">Master Page Sections</a></h2>
            
            <p>All of the normal page content goes into a section called "content", available in the
                master page as <tt>$this->content</tt>. If you want to force part of a page into a
                different section, as in the "footer" section above, you can make that happen using
                this kind of code in the page:</p>
            <code>&lt;h1>Hello, world!&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>This is my first page!&lt;/p>

<tt>@footer {</tt>
&lt;p>And this text goes into the footer.&lt;/p>
<tt>}</tt></code>
            <p>Of course, since the master page is always a <tt>.phtml</tt> file - otherwise the
                template expansion wouldn't work - there is no limit to the amount of PHP code you
                can embed in your system.</p>
            
            <!-- Styles -->
            <h2><a name="styles">Styles</a></h2>
            
            <p>The ability to switch between different master pages is regulated in the settings.ini
                file.</p>
            <code>style = default</code>
            <p>...is the default style; and the system will then look for a master template as
                <tt>/pages/_master/default.phtml</tt> and all of the CSS files should, by convention,
                be stored as <tt>/css/default/*.css</tt>.</p>
            <p>By switching this variable to anything else, you may switch the global style within
                seconds. The system will simply look for a different master page, which will then in
                turn load all the dependent CSS stylesheets, scripts and so on.</p>
            <p>There is also a predefined way of using two different master pages for the same site -
                if you want a radically different first page and more conventional subpages after that.
                Instead of naming your master page <tt>default.phtml</tt>, you may give it the following
                names:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b><i>style</i>-front.phtml</b> - the index page for the site.</li>
                <li><b><i>style</i>-page.phtml</b> - subpages master page.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>So having two files, default-front.phtml and default-page.phtml will give you two
                different layouts to work with.</p>
            
            <!-- Menus -->
            <h2><a name="menus">Menus</a></h2>
            
            <p>The way that the framework implements menus is to simply use a separate menu definition
                file - <tt>menu.ini</tt> - and serve it up as a series of <tt>ul/li</tt> elements, with
                submenus embedded inside a single <tt>li</tt> element.</p>
            <p>This is nothing extravagant, but there is a minimal CSS ruleset and javascript that
                handles this; this can be deleted or improved upon without difficulty.</p>
            <p>The menu file might look like this:</p>
            <code>[main]
Main            = /

Company         = about/company
Company/About   = about/company
Company/Contact = about/contact-us

Products        = products
Products/MV8000 = products/mv8000
Products/Z35    = products/z35

Solutions       = solutions</code>
            <p>Each page is precededed by the title of page, and then a reference to the URL. If a submenu
                is desired, just separate the heading and title with a slash, i.e. "Company/About".</p>
            <p>You can easily embed a direct link in the menu, like this:</p>
            <code>Our Partner = http://www.partner.com/</code>
            <p>The main menu can always be embedded in a page - preferably the master page - by using
                this statement:</p>
            <code>&lt;?= Menu::main() ?></code>

            <!-- Submenus -->
            <h2><a name="submenus">Submenus</a></h2>
            
            <p>You can also embed submenus - menus different from the main menu - by adding separate sections
                like this:</p>
            <code>[about]
Company/About   = about/company
Company/Contact = about/contact-us
</code>
            <p>The system will then try to match the URL for the current page being displayed, and try
                to find the submenu that matches best (by comparing URLs). The submenu will then be rendered
                with this call:</p>
            <code>&lt;?= Menu::submenu() ?></code>
            <p>This will give you a completely separate <tt>ul/li</tt> menu that can be embedded in a different
                section of the page.</p>
            
            <!-- Settings -->
            <h2><a name="settings">Settings</a></h2>
            
            <p>The standard settings file looks like this:</p>
            <code>title       = "Company"
description = "Main web page for company.com"
og_image    = "http://company.com/images/default.jpg"
og_sitename = "company.com"

email       = "info@company.com"

style       = default
cache       = false</code>
            <p>There are actually only two variables that the system uses: <b>style</b> and <b>cache</b>. The
                rest are quite simply inserted into the master page as <tt>$this-><i>variable</i></tt>. This can
                be useful to easily customize the master page with different titles or descriptions.</p>
            <p>There is nothing that prevents you from adding additional variables. They will all be available
                in the global variable <tt>$settings['<i>variable</i>']</tt> and inside the master template 
                as <tt>$this-><i>variable</i></tt>.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>style</b> is used to select the master page, as previously discussed.</li>
                <li><b>cache</b> can be either "true" or "false"; it's only purpose is to add a <tt>Cache:</tt> HTTP
                    header with a timeout of one hour - for HTML and Markdown pages. PHTML pages will never be cached,
                    as they should be evaluated each time.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <!-- Markdown -->
            <h2><a name="markdown">Markdown Syntax</a></h2>
            
            <p>Markdown is a kind of cool way of writing perfectly normal text and have the system automatically
                create HTML markup from the text. This framework relies on the implementation from
                <a href="https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/">Michel Fortin</a>.</p>
            <p>The idea is that you should be able to write text something like this:</p>
            <code>Welcome
=======

You have the following options when trying to evaluate **this system**.

* Option 1
* Option 2
* Option 3</code>

            <p>And this will be rendered as:</p>
            <code>&lt;h1>Welcome&lt;/h1>
            
&lt;p>You have the following options when trying to evaluate &lt;em>this system&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>Option 1&lt;/li>
    &lt;li>Option 2&lt;/li>
    &lt;li>Option 3&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></code>
