Sample index page
=================

Welcome! You have come to the MicroPhpFw website, illustrating the capabilities
of the Micro PHP Framework. It is a completely text-based framework with
templating capabilities, in less than 500 lines of PHP and JS code (aside from
the JQuery and MarkDown libraries).

There is no database, no editing support, no administration, just simple text
files. Should be secure enough, incredibly lightweight, and yet easy enough
to be used with a minimum of introduction.

Since we use MarkDown for most of the pages, it should also be editable by
just about anyone<sup>*)</sup>.
